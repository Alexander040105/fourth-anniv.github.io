                Hi love belated merry christmas and advance happy new yearrrrr so ayorn mukhang mapapaaga pagiimplement
                ko nitong site since ya know the oasys playlist HLKASDJFHASLKDFHSA pero ayun I made this to ano to remember 
                our 4 years through the different musics na naging part ng playlist natin, mo and mostly sakin kasi I also did this
                kasi ayun nga as mentioned sa other page nitong site na I remember the time na you asked me on discord if ano yung lately pinapakinggan ko
                and I want to make it special din for our anniversary this January but ayun medyo napabilis ako ng slight sa paggawa HLKSADFJHLASF
                and ayun I linked the spotify links nung mga songs from this site. So ayorn nga ano I hope you enjoyed it even though it's like 10% of my composed
                playlist. So imma summarize na lang per artists siguro so uhm... 5 seconds of summer, the band that got our spark for the second time around since 
                the merryhills incident that messed our connection because of me and ayun I love how their music describes you and me. Tay tay, she's one of our
                ya know part of the love playlist you brought me to her more kasi I only listen to her mainstreams like you belong with me ganon kasi I have a sister ganorn
                then you know enchanted, I'm very enchanted to meet you love and ayun I love shiny things but I'd definitely marry you even if it's paper rings love:>. 
                Nextouuuuu, is the ghorls STAYC, uhm they're the best aside sa maganda visuals nila they remind me of you since they're also my comfort and they're definitely
                a mix of you basta ganon from yoon to sumin ganon basta they remind me of you lalo nung pandemic where I discovered them ayorn it's kinda like my another akeisha
                that'll comfort me ganon HSADFHFSDHSADFHAS idk basta. Ayun N.Flying, shesh another band from my playlist na namansz shesh anona HDSHSAHDSAH ayun N.flying like much
                STAYC they're also my comfort right when me and my siz discoveredddd them yun nga kasi gago astig ng songs nila kasi astig nila magarrange ng songs aside sa pogi sila::> And
                ayun some of their songs remind me of you like the rooftop, sunset, so pretty, and lovefool and yeah their musicality is great lalo sa live and ayon next is Over October
                wherein I stumbled upon them after a random Live at Cozy Cove vid where they sang Intertwine and ayun it definitely describes our relationship mahal and their songs
                makes me feel and think more that love is great and loving you is great which describes how I am feeling with youu and ayorn it suits us especially yung 123 where one love that is shared by two,
                two hearts beating me and you, three words I LOVE YOU. Shesh wala pa sa kalahati HASHSAFDHSAH and next is the peggies anotha one from my playlist I love them since they're a women N.flying and ayun
                IDK basta nakuha nila yung music taste ko siguro and they are the feel good musiccc and the rollercoaster emotions from their other songs na from centimeter to the focking sad Anemone and Door.
                Next is yorushika, anotherrrr japanese bandddd they are a band that can focking produce emotions from you they're more than a roller coasteer they can focking make songs that sound happy but conveys sadness
                they can focking give you emotional focking ride with their songs like the song hitchcock just search the translated lyrics HHSADFHSADFHAFSDASH ayun shesh I cannot explain them further HSADFHFSDHSADFHAS
                Nextouu is Jannabi they're another korean OG band that has that nostalgic feels sa songs nila kaya it sounds good and ayorn I think you liked it naman when you heard them before when we're shs and ayun goods den lyrics nila
                Shesh ang next is yung ONEWE uhmm I liked them since goods yung kanta nilang Regulus na derived from the 'The Little Prince' ba yon basta yung goods na palabaassss na ano yung bata na ano basta nagtravel sila after non to other planets
                and someshit basta goodshit yon and ayorn goods vocals nila and shesh goods den yung mga riffs nila and thingz na goods sa bands. So ayorn LUCY, you've heard them namanz beforee and ayun their good since
                they gave another like new thing don sa pagiging band nila kasi ya know they maximized Yechan's violinnn sa mga songs nila and they describe you on their songs HSHSHSHSHS they remind me of you mahal.
                Next is from OPM namanz ulit we've gotttt Lola Amour shesh apakamainstream pero they deserve it naman lalo pag live I wanna take you to their live performance soon kasi I can feel na maeenjoy mo din yung 
                energy nila and musicality sa live na iba sa mga recorded from spotify and thingsz and shesh galing din nila talaga mag arrange ng music so yeah shesh.
                Next is Dilaw, just like Lola Amour they're also fucking goods sa live and ya know even though naging mainstream sila because of uhaw, I like hhow they are creative when it comes to how  they
                present their music to turn it into another version somehow and ayorn you've heard some of their other songs na din since yun ang laman ng playlist ko when we are on the way to school ASDFHASDHSFH
                lalo yung janice aww 'saglit lang tayo munang dalawa::>' shesh and yeahhhhhhhhh goodshit. Another OPM uli is the kafrennies ng overoctober which is yung the Ridleys, which I discovered
                dahil sa song nila na Aphrodite and random YouTube magic na namanz and yeah I see the galaxies when I look in your eye and I swear to Zeus you're Aphrodite in disguise, don't think that you can hide it from me::> I also  love their songs
                Germany and Rome since right now on college we are distanced literally since our schools are diff  na and germany and rome describes us that we can find a middleground even if there's a distancee between us sometimes.
                Next is back to korean namansz which is QWER, I just discovered them last month because of another YouTube algo magic na inaattract ako sa pretty girls like you  na nagbaband + naka-paul reed smith(PRS) guitars astig goods yung songs nila especially
                yung secret diary and discord pati yung harmony of the stars HSADFHFSDHSADFHAS. thennnnn ayorn mayonnaiseeeeeee shesh medyo tito Bands pero yeah goods yung mga arrangements nila sa liveeeeeeeee like what the fock and yunn nga they touch some of the
                bandd + lovesongs on a different way from Porta, kumander and Paraan ayorn they're focking goods. Next is anotha k-band na namanz HHASDHFSADAHSFH shesh The Rose naman is sheshableeee nadiscover lang din namin sila ni ate dahil sa ILYSB cover nilaa and yung
                Marry you cover nila sa KBS pero holy sheeesh nung I checked their discography they have some really good songs and lovesongs ganon and apakasad nung ibang songs nila and sheeesh yung line from the She's in the Rain na "It's better to be held than holding on" and the lines behind this part 
                owshi talaga. nexxxttou is (G)-IDLE ayorn I loved them since they have a song sa LOL kasi 2 of them is kinuha as voices for the skins para sa KPOP themed skins ng LoL characs and eventually naging song na din talaga nila yon
                pero ayorn tumatak sila sakin kasi anggaling nung mga music elements from  their songs and sheshable can't describe it na HSADHASHDASDFH. And ayorn back to OPM, sheeesh Sunkissed Lola ayornnn lately ko lang silang pinakinggan kasi narecommend na namann
                ni yt saken yung Paki Sabi which is one of their good songs aside sa Pasilyo then ayunnn godos den yung White Toyota shehs very chill songggggg. Sheesh last 2 artists na lang ata HSDAHFASHDFHSDFH IDK napakahaba and di ako gagamit ng linebreak para mmaiba naman
